# iMetrics

## Overview 

This library provides a set of image metrics that you can run out of the box. The metrics 
can be used directly on [iTypes](https://github.com/eddy-ilg/itypes.git) Datasets. Those are 
basic dataset definitions that can model sequences of 2D data as they appear in 
almost any 2D vision task. The datasets can be directly visualized super easily 
with [iViz](https://github.com/eddy-ilg/iviz). 

___Tutorials and YouTube videos will be made available in the second
half of 2022.___
